## Pulumi 3.0

In April we released [Pulumi 3.0]({{< relref "/blog/pulumi-3-0" >}}) with new features and improvements, including:

- [Multi-lang packages]({{< relref "/blog/pulumiup-pulumi-packages-multi-language-components" >}}) that let you author components in one language and reuse them with another language
- The [Azure Native Provider]({{< relref "/blog/pulumiup-pulumi-packages-multi-language-components" >}}), built from the Azure API daily, was released for General Availability.
- We also released a public preview of the [Google Cloud Native Provider]{{< relref "/blog/pulumiup-google-native-provider" >}}) to give Pulumi users the best support possible. Native Providers ensure that you have complete coverage and the latest features as they are released.
- Updates to the [Pulumi Console]({{< relref "/blog/pulumiup-ci-cd-assistant-all-plans" >}}) with more information about your organization's projects, guided integration with source control management systems such as Github, and deep integration with popular CI/CD systems
- Improved developer experience with enumerations and documentation with hovering tooltips
- Announcing General Availability and more language examples with [Automation API](((< relref "/pulumiup-automation-api-ga" >))), Pulumi's cloud infrastructure provisioning tool and SDK

We've also refreshed our website to make it easier to navigate and updated our docs with examples.

If you weren't able to attend PulumiUP!, a two hour cloud engineering mini-conference, you can watch the video featuring our great speakers and panel .

## Events

We've updated our [Events]({{< relref "/resources" >}}) page with topics ranging from deploying Kubernetes, building reusable components, and working with cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. You can register for upcoming events and watch videos of past events on the [Events]({{< relref "/resources" >}}) page.

And don't forget to watch [Modern Infrastructure Wednesdays](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLyy8Vx2ZoWloyj3V5gXzPraiKStO2GGZw") where we demonstrate the latest cloud features in video shorts.
